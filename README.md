**[PollsterAudit.ca](https://www.pollsteraudit.ca)** is a public-interest initiative to **hold Canadian election opinion polling companies accountable** through transparent and accessible data. Polls influence public perception, media coverage, and even voter behavior—yet not all pollsters are equally reliable or transparent. This project audits and analyzes the track records of Canadian polling firms so citizens, journalists, and researchers can make more informed decisions.

> 🛠️ This project is fully **open-source** because transparency starts with us. Anyone can review how the website works, suggest improvements, or verify our sources. Democracy benefits when the tools used to understand it are open to all.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Elections are the backbone of democracy. When polls mislead or manipulate, the public suffers. By making data-driven audits of pollsters freely available, we aim to raise the standard of public discourse in Canada.

> Help us shine a light on the truth, because democracy deserves better data.
